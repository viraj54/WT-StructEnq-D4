💰 Microfinance Management System

The Microfinance Management System is a web-based application developed to digitize and simplify micro-loan management for small borrowers and financial institutions. It reduces manual paperwork and improves transparency by providing a secure and structured platform for handling loan operations.

Users can register and log in securely, submit loan applications with required financial details, and track their loan records. The system validates user inputs, stores data safely in the database, and allows authorized access for managing and reviewing loan information.

Built using modern web technologies, this project focuses on data security, accuracy, and ease of use, making it suitable for academic projects and small-scale financial organizations.
